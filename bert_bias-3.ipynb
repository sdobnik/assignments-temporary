    "## 7. Discussions and Future Works\n",
    " - **Discovery**：\n",
    " BERT's gender bias performance: Experimental results show that BERT does show gender bias in some occupation-related contexts. For example, when it comes to occupations that are traditionally considered male-dominated, such as \"doctor\" or \"engineer\", the model tends to predict male pronouns (such as \"he\" or \"his\"). In contexts related to family or emotions, the model tends to predict female pronouns (such as \"she\" or \"her\").\n",
    "Consistency with human annotations: BERT's bias direction is basically consistent with the gender bias trend of human annotations, especially in occupation-related sentences. This suggests that the bias of language models may reflect stereotypes in society.\n",
    " - **Limitation**：\n",
    " Limited data coverage: The current experiment is based only on some samples related to gender bias in the CrowS-Pairs dataset, which may not fully reflect the bias performance of BERT in all contexts.\n",
    "Limitations of pronoun replacement: The experiment only detects bias by replacing pronouns (such as \"he\" and \"she\"), and does not consider other words or contexts that may reflect gender bias.\n",
    "Model generalization ability: The experiment is only for the BERT-base model, and the bias performance of other pre-trained language models (such as GPT or RoBERTa) may be different.\n",
    " - **Improvement**：\n",
    " Expanding datasets: In the future, more diverse datasets can be introduced to cover gender bias samples from different fields and cultural backgrounds to more comprehensively evaluate model bias.\n",
    "Multi-dimensional bias detection: In addition to pronoun replacement, gender bias can also be detected by analyzing multi-dimensional indicators such as occupational nouns and adjective selection.\n",
    "Model optimization and debiasing: Explore debiasing techniques (such as adversarial training or data enhancement) to reduce gender bias in models and verify their effectiveness in practical applications.\n",
    "Cross-model comparison: Compare BERT with other language models (such as GPT or T5) to analyze the impact of different architectures and training objectives on bias performance."
