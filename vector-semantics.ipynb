    "\n",
    "In this task, we are going to examine how the composed vectors of phrases by different semantic composition functions/models introduced in [2] correlate with human judgements of similarity between phrases. We will use the dataset from this paper which is stored in `mitchell_lapata_acl08.txt`. If you are interested about further details about this task also refer to this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Process the dataset. The dataset contains human judgemements of similarity between phrases recorded one per line. The first column indicates the id of a participant making a judgement (`participant`), the next column is `verb`, followed by `noun` and `landmark`. From these three columns we can construct phrases that were compared by human informants, namely `verb noun` vs `verb landmark`. The next column `input` indicates a similarity score a participant assigned to a pair of such phrases on a scale from 1 to 7 where 1 is lowest and 7 is highest. The last column `hilo` groups the phrases into two sets: phrases where we expect low and phrases where we expect high similarity scores. This is because we want to test our compositional functions on two tasks and examine whether a function is discriminative between them. Correlation between scores could also be due to other reasons than semantic similarity and hence good prediction on both tasks simultaneously shows that a function is truly discriminating the phrases using some semantic criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "For extracting information you can use the code from the lecture to start with. How to structure this data is up to you - a dictionary-like format would be a good choice. Remember that each example was judged by several participants and phrases will repeat in the dataset. Therefore, you have to collect all judgments for a particular set of phrases and average them. This will become useful in step (iii).\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Compose the vectors of the extracted word pairs by testing different compositional functions. In the lecture we introduced simple additive, simple multiplicative and combined models (details are described in [2]). Your task is to take a pair of phrases, e.g. the first example in the dataset `stray thought` and `stray roam` and for each phrase compute a composition of the vectors of their words using these functions, using one function per experiment run. For each phrase you will get a single vector. You can encode the words with any vector space introduced earlier (standard space, ppmi or svd) but your code should be structured in a way that it will be easy to switch between them. Finally, take the resulting (composed) vectors of phrase pairs in the dataset and calculate a cosine similarity between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Now you have cosine similairity scores between vectors of phrases but how do they compare with the average human scores that you calculated from the individual judgements from the `input` column of the dataset for the same phrases? Calculate Spearman rank correlation coefficient between two lists of the scores both for the `high` and the `low` task . \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Spearmank rank correlation coefficient (or Spearman's rho) rather than Peason's correlation coefficent because we cannot compare cosine scores with human judgements directly. Cosine is a constinuous measure and human judgements are expressed as ranks. Also, we cannot say if 0.28 to 1 is the same (or different) to 6 to 7 in the human scores.  The Spearman rank correlation coeffcient turns the scores for all examples within each group first to ranks and then these ranks are correlated (or approximated to a linear function). \n",
